/*
Write a function, called countTo, that takes up to 3 arguments: a start value, an end point, and a step value.
The first and third arguments are optional. It should return a comma seperated string. The last character shouldn't be followed by a comma.
If not specified, the start value defaults to 0. If not specified, the step value defaults to 1.
If only two arguments are specified, they should be taken as the start and end.
Eg. countTo(1) --> '0,1'
countTo(2, 5) --> '2,3,4,5'
countTo(0,10,2) --> '0,2,4,6,8,10'
The step value must always be positive. If the start is higher than the end, it should return an empty string.
*/

function countTo(start = 0, end, step = 1) {
  let count = [];
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i += step) {
    count.push(i);
  }
  console.log(count);
}

countTo(0, 10, 3);

module.exports = countTo;
